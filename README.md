# ESLint
## Learning goal
In this assignment, the goal is to get familiar with static code analysers (or so-called linters: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)). Learn what they are good for, and how to use them in a project.

## Task 0 - Get some code
Choose one of your former assignments 4.X for this exercise. Either copy the code or use the same local version but add a new remote via Git (https://jigarius.com/blog/multiple-git-remote-repositories).

## Task 1 - Make sure Node/NPM is on the latest version
To avoid any issues with ESLint installation, make sure you have the latest version of NodeJS/NPM installed: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/update-node-js-version#ftoc-heading-3

## Task 2 - Install ESLint
Follow the instructions to install ESLint and initialize it for you repository: https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started. <br/>
When you're being asked to choose a code-style, feel free to use whatever you like (Google, AirBnB, XO, doesn't matter really).

## Task 3 - Running ESLint
### Task 3.1 - Manual error resolution
Run ESLint on a single file (https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface). What errors or warnings are presented on your CLI? Try to understand why they are appearing and how to fix them.

### Task 3.2 - Automatic fixes
After you've done some manual fixes, try to run the `eslint --fix` command and see how your files have changed. Push your fixed code as a merge request/fork to this assignment.
